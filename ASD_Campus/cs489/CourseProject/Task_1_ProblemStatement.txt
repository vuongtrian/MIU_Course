- Every reservation has a unique reservation number
- For every reservation, the system records the stat date, end date, total price,
number of guest, room, customer first name, last name, email, address info and credit card info
- Whenever the customer places a reservation, cancel or change a reservation,
we want to measure the time it takes for the actions to execute and store the result to database
