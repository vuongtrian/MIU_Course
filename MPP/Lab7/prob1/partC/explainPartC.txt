Explain: the result is false because method listsAreEqual always return false
Reason: Employee class only override equals without hashCode. In the first call hashMap.put, it hash to some bucket
and next call hashMap.put, it hash to another bucket.
So, although they are equal, as they don't hash to the same bucket, the map can't realize it and both of them stay in the map.
