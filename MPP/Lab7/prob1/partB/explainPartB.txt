Explain: the result is false because method listsAreEqual always return false
Reason: Employee class didn't override equals & hashCode,
the collection use a hashcode value of an object to determine how it should be stored inside a collection,
and the hashcode is used again in order to locate the object in its collection.
Since you created two different objects, while they have the same value as attributes they're two distincts objects and hence return false
